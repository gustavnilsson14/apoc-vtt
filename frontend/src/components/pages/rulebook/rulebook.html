            <p>Combat happens when people disagree violently, and is resolved in the following way, usually involving bruises, blood, and death.</p>

            <p>The following are core concepts of the combat system.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Combat takes place on a 1d battle mat called the <i>Battleground</i>. You either push forward, or fall back.</li>
                <li>Combat has two measures of time. <i>Rounds</i>, which consists of an arbitrary amount of <i>Turns</i></li>
                <li>Combatants can only specify their actions at the beginning of each <i>Round</i>, while during this time, their actions each <i>Turn</i> is dictated by their planning</li>
                <li>Combat ends when at the end of a <i>Round</i> either one side is defeated, or has fled the battleground</li>
                <li>Exploiting an enemys <i>weaknesses</i> is important to fighting effectively</li>
                <li>Likewise, using terrain, features, and hazards of the battlegrounds is equally important</li>
                <li>Combatants are likely to be permanently damaged, die, or be kidnapped in the aftermath of combat, players, and their opponents alike</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Battleground</h2>
            <p>The Battleground consists of 13 tiles, where two sides can duke it out.</p>
            <p>When the battle starts the GM first decides two tile ranges for the position of the two opposing parties,depending on the scene. Players may place their characters on any tile within the tile range they were assigned, usually spanning 3~ tiles.</p>

            <h3>Movement</h3>
            <p>Combatants may move 1 tile at the start of every round if taking the <i>dash</i> tactical action, then 1 tile at the start of each turn.</p>
            <p>These rules apply to movement</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Conscious combatants of opposing sides may not occupy the same tile.</li>
                <li>Combatants of the same side may occupy the same tile, and move freely through tiles occupied by their allies.</li>
                <li>A combatant cannot move past an opponent.</li>
                <li>Opposing combatants moving into the same tile roll 1d12, adding their strength to the result. The lower result will be unable to move</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Depending on the combatants perks and/or equipment, they may be able to move further, or ignore some rules regarding invalid movement. These rules are also designed for mainly grounded combat. Aerial combat, or underwater combat would have different rules for movement.</p>

        <box>
            <h3>Features</h3>
            <p>Battlegrounds will have features, such as vantage points, explosives, cover, doorways, and whatever the GM dreams up. The location of these features should be marked on the battleground, and their stats should be noted down in advance. How to interact with these features can vary, but mostly requires a tactical action.</p>

            <h3>Setup</h3>
            <p>As combat starts, all combatants of each respective side are placed on opposing sides, at tile #3. The GM may then, at their discretion move combatants forward, or backwards up to 2 tiles, depending on their perception of how the battle started.</p>

            <h4>First Strike</h4>
            <p>If a combatant was caught by surprise, with their weapons sheethed and guard down, the initiators may get a first strike. This allows any combatant who was combat ready as the combat starts to attack a non-combat ready combatant within range once.</p>

            <h4>Ambush</h4>
            <p>If either side ambushed the other side, seemingly springing up from nowhere, trapping or surrounding their opponents, the combat starts as an ambush.</p>
            <p>When placing combatants on the battleground when an ambush happens, place the ambushed side on tile #6, and the ambushers on a tile #1 of their choice.</p>
            <p>During the first <i>round</i> of an ambush, the ambushers choose how many <i>turns</i> it would last.</p>
        </box>

        <box>
            <h3>Rounds and Turns</h3>
            <p>A round of combat is an amount of turns decided by both the fighting parties. A turn of combat is enough time for every combatant involved to move, and perform an action.</p>

            <h4>Commitment</h4>
            <p>As a round of combat starts, the GM rolls 1d10 for initiative. If the result is below or equal to the initiative threshold, the players has it, if above the enemies have it</p>
            <p>Turn amount starts at 3. After rolling for initiative,  the side which gets it chooses to increase, or decrease the turn amount by 1.</p>
            <p>After determining turn amount, all combatants take tactical action, then plan for the round</p>

        <box class="x1-5">
            <h3>Tactical action (TA)</h3>
            <p>Tactical actions are special actions which can be performed by all combatants, and allows combatants to adapt to an enemies strengths, or exploit their tactics.</p>
            <p>All combatants may use the TA's listed below, but will also have special actions available to them.</p>
            <p>After determining the turn amount for the <i>round</i>, each combatant may take a <i>tactical action</i></p>
            <p>Tactical actions resolve immediately, and simultaneously.</p>

            <p>After escaping the combatant will get away from their enemies, and automatically take a 10 minute break. After the break, the combatant will have their endurance fully restored, but might be separated from their allies, depending on how they escaped.</p>

                    <p>Spells are manipulation of the foreign energies landed on the planet, also known as magic. These all have powerful effects, and are inherently damaging to the target and volatile such as they might damage the caster. Each spell has an amount of charges, and may be used until those are depleted.</p>
                    <p>In combat casting spells is done as a tactical action. The caster decides on the amount of charges to spend, and the spell deals damage, and increases its volatility for each charge spent.</p>
                    <p>Each spell charge spent up to the skill level of the spell increases its damage by 2d8. Each charge which exceeds the skill level increases damage by 1d8.</p>

            <p>When opposing melee combatants meet on the battleground a front is created. How melee attackers are allowed to attack, and how the front moves, has specific rules.</p>

            <h4>Rules of attacking</h4>
            <p>Before any opposing combatant in a front can be the target of two attacks during the same turn, every enemy combatant must be the target of an attack. Only if your side of the front outnumber the other side, you can target the same target as one of your allies.</p>

            <p>All things a character carries with them which are of note are represented by a item card. Item cards represent any weapons, protection, or tools the character carries and have at their disposal. The character sheet, and vehicle sheets has dedicated slots to contain item cards, which also denote how the item is carried.</p>
            <p>Items carried in the characters hands or belt can be used in combat, while items carried on the characters body are items worn or strapped to them, and items in the 3 inventory slots are items stored in a backpack.</p>

            <h3>Stats</h3>
            <p>All items have stats, but depending on the type of the item the stats may mean different things.</p>
            <h4>Quality</h4>
            <p>The round slots are called quality. The quality of an item counts as both a durability, and an effect icon. Filling in the quality slot as the result of damaging the item will also result in the quality being lost for effect purposes.</p>
            <h4>Durability</h4>
            <p>The durability of an item is a measure of how much damage the item can withstand. When all durability, and quality slots are filled in as a result of damage, an item is destroyed.</p>
            <h4>Effect</h4>
            <p>The effect of an item counts towards either the damage rating, or armor value of the item. Quality also adds to this</p>
        </box>
        <box>
            <h3>Item damage</h3>
            <p>When an item is either used for somthing it is not intended for, suffers rough physical treatment, is partially or completely consumed, or due to combat, it takes damage.</p>
            <p>When an item takes damage, cross out the first durability or quality slot (starting from the top left) which is not yet filled in.</p>
            <p>Some items, at the GM's discretion are not destroyed when all durability or quality slots are filled in, and may be recharged or refilled, although this is an exception</p>
            <h4>Combat damage</h4>
            <p>After combat, roll 1d6 for each item used that combat. If the die result is less than or equal to the amount of rounds, during which that it was used that combat, it loses one durability</p>
            <h4>Repair</h4>
            <p>Repairing a weapon may restore sturdy quality slots. Repairing a quality slot will take some time, and resources, usually worth around ~75% of what the quality slot would cost if new.</p>

                            The people living in the cities of the old world are commonly known as scavengers, or scavs for short. They are quite sceptical of outsiders of their small tribes, but form tight loyalties and friendships once they accept new blood. Scrap, doodads and trash is plenty in the ruins, so resources are plenty for crafting. 
                            Food, and drinking water is more scarce as the soil is bad for farming, and water usually floods then flows off.  Stockpiled food also has a tendency to attract roidrats, jellies, or raids from Saurian tribes.

                        <p>Where you find good soil, clean groundwater, and less contaminants, you  will find that small authoritarian settlements form naturally, which are commonly called conclaves. These vary in alignment when it comes to ethics, but always strictly enforce their laws. Many conclaves are indifferent of outsiders, viewing them as lower caste, and of less value than the conclave citizens. While heavily onset by raiders, conclaves are usually equipped for the task, with quality defenses prepared for the inevitable invasions.</p>

                        <p>Traveling the radioactive, toxic, and barren zones of the new world is a dangerous life. Here you find the bravest  explorers, most pious believers,  and a lot of mentally deranged  people, as well as mutants  and dangerous artificial  demigods of the old world.  The zone has neither clean  food or water, but the most  valuable, and curious  artifacts. Venture too deep  and you will find the  Deadlands, where you will die  to heavy radiation, test  dummies, or the feared Chrome pyramid.</p>

                        <p>The sour swamps of the new world are brimming with life adapted to the new conditions. Swamp People live and in some manner thrive here, a generally spiritual yet rough group. The Swamp People’s primary trait is their relation to, and handling of the wildlife  in the new world swamps, which also in many cases is their livelihood. To the outsider, the swamp is often a deathtrap. Many creatures here lay in ambush, and a failure to read the signs will cause a wanderer to be either consumed by swamp kelp, captured by the gators, eaten by ticks, crayfish, or leeches, or to just drown in a whirlpool.</p>

                        <p>Sentient remnants of the old world, super quality at their time, but after centuries without repairs are a dying kind. Androids are self replicating given the conditions to do so, but after the collapse this has not been so. Severed from the network, the local auxiliary AI’s took over the individual android bodies, as the decades  passed by they evolved into individuals. Usually, androids are met with courtesy, but restraint. Many humans either push them away, or try to exploit them. Few friendship bonds are formed with androids, even though it is certainly possible.</p>

                        <p>Designer made, ageless, and peerless. Synthetic humans are amazing creatures, yet they more than often suffer from a lack of direction. If this is a byproduct of their long lifespan, or if they were made this way anyone who could say is long since dead. Synthetics are normally shun as soulless and unpredictable, which is sometimes all too correct. Those who are not, may grow to lead groups or settlements to great futures, but these are few indeed. Prone to madness and depression, most synthetics wander alone.</p>
